# Ravelin Fraud Detection

Hi, this private repository is for Ravelin's Data Science Test. There are 2 things in this repository:

1)[clean_code.ipynb](https://github.com/Hsgngr/ravelin_fraud_detection/blob/main/clean_code.ipynb) is the notebook that I created for this task.
2)[Report.md](https://github.com/Hsgngr/ravelin_fraud_detection/blob/main/REPORT.md) explains my approach to the task.
